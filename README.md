# Trial of Valor

This is a **companion app** for a prototype **board game** called Trial of Valor. The game is based on the concept of the [Talisman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talisman_(board_game)) game and expands on its ideas. The app helps with **micromanagement**, which is somewhat problematic in board games played IRL. It serves as a **game master** and a virtual **character sheet** with a **quest log**.

You can check out the app [here](https://m-biernat.github.io/trial-of-valor/) or download it as a **single HTML file** from the releases.

## Features

- The single multipurpose companion app for online and offline use;
- **Game Master** mode serves as a NPC controller;
- **Character Manager** mode manages character sheet and quests;
- **Deck Preview** shows all cards in the deck (and you can print them);

*The Game Master should be running on the one 'main' device and the Character Manager should be running on separate devices, e.g., smartphones.*

From developer perspective:
- deploying a static single-page app into GitHub Pages;
- fetching data from Google Sheets;
- building a single HTML file for offline use.
